## Installation

Most of the requirements of this projects are exactly the same as [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark). If you have any problem of your environment, you should check their [issues page](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/issues) first. Hope you will find the answer.

### Step-by-step installation

```bash
# Here we directly provide the instll.bash file for convenient installation. 
# first, make sure that your conda is setup properly with the right environment
# for that, check that `which conda`, `which pip` and `which python` points to the
# right path. From a clean conda env, this is what you need to do

conda create --name iPerceive -y
conda activate iPerceive

# Then just run:
sh install.sh
```
